# weather-dashboard

todo : 
google font (maybe)

delete child elements to prevent clutter

add icons from open weather (possible d+n with momentjs)

add a search history (maybe not btns so different eventlistener) 

search history must be able to click and get updated data 
(save localStorage search term/city name only and re send it through api)
(saves it when search button is pressed (grab global-name maybe?))
